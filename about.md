My name is Sreekanth Reddy Balne, I'm a software developer from India.  I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Allahabad, U.P, India. My inspiration for choosing this field is Web Development. I always wanted to have a personal blog, and now that's fulfilled, currently my prime focus is into DevOps.

I constantly dig into Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, RxJS, Typescript, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Terraform.
